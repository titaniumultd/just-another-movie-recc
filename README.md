# Just Another Movie Recommendation System

This is an educational repository that contains the code for a personalized movie recommendation system. The recommendation system uses both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to recommend movies based on user preferences and behavior.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset, which contains millions of movie ratings.

The smallest dataset is included in the repository. You can use any of the MoveLens datasets by downloading them into the ./data/ folder.

## Project Structure

This project is currently in progress, and divided into the following steps:

1. Data Collection and Cleaning: Collecting the dataset and cleaning it for further use.
2. Data Analysis and Visualization: Analyzing and visualizing the data to get insights.
3. Preprocessing: Preprocessing the data for the recommendation system.
4. Building the Recommendation System: Building the recommendation system using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the recommendation system.
6. Deployment: Deploying the model as a web app.

## Setup

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the MovieLens dataset from [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) and place it in the `data/` directory.
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks in order.
